       "[Document(page_content='Metaphysics of Awareness\\r\\rIn many respects, one can consider the age that we live in, the Quantum Era, as one of intense intellectual \\rcrisis and turmoil, very much analogous to the crisis that the intellectuals faced during the Enlightenment Era \\rafter the world had almost literally been turned upside down. We see clear indications of this crisis, \\rmanifestations as it were, on the world stage with \\r\\ri.\\tglobal warming: a threat on a scale that we as a global community have ever faced before and has the \\rpotential for devastating consequences, some of which are already starting to see. Changing climate \\rleading to shortages of and lack of food and water, large scale people unrest and movement leading to \\rfurther political instability. ii. nuclear proliferation: an increasing number of nation states have access to, and are actively working on, \\rnuclear weaponry, \\riii. rise of radical extremism: aka Terrorism, which primarily is looked at through an Islamic lens but runs \\rdeeper than that and is not necessarily a fundamentally religious problem much less an Islamic one,\\riv.\\n\\nthe rise of nationalism: aka populism that is sweeping through Western democracies like a cancer almost, \\rBrexit and the rise of Trumpism in the United States as perhaps the most glaring examples, and\\rv.\\tincreasing wealth inequality: leading to general unrest and broad class inequality even within wealthy \\rnations, also starting to take root between nations as well, \\r\\rAll of these socio-political trends, and particularly those that are leading to socio-political instability and \\rchange, grouped with the threat of Terrorism and nuclear proliferation, together significantly increase the \\rprobability of not just instability, but conflict and destruction at a scale that we have not encountered in the \\rhistory of mankind. Furthermore, many of these threats, or trends, are a direct result of, or at least are \\rpartially caused by, ideological differences and/or deficiencies. This is the case in particular with respect to \\rthe rise of nationalism, increasing income inequality, as well as Terrorism, both underlying socio-political \\rtrends that, when paired with Global Warming and the resulting shift in access to resources, put mankind in a \\rprecarious position indeed.\\n\\nIf we take them all together then, given their global scope and reach, and given the ideological basis for at \\rleast a core group of them, it is not too much of a stretch to argue that at least some degree (and we would \\rargue to a large degree), these trends are a function of, a direct result of, the proliferation of Western \\rideology throughout the world which rests on not so much democracy and freedom (although this is what \\rmany of our leaders in the West would have us believe), but more so on capitalism and materialism, precisely \\rthe hot buttons for the radical extremists, which in turn drive radical (religious) extremism to a large extent. Therefore, it is a logical and rational deduction to conclude that these trends, these problems and challenges \\rthat characterize the modern era within which we live, while manifesting of course on the material or \\rphysical plane, if not addressed ideologically, are fundamentally unsolvable - each of them potentially having \\rdevastating effects to the global community and all of them together representing arguably the greatest \\rthreat mankind has ever faced, certainly modern man.\\n\\nFrom a pure intellectual perspective, from a metaphysical perspective, we see analogs for these ideological \\rchallenges in the domain of Physics, crystalizing in the search for a so-called Unified Field Theory, a quest first \\routlined by Einstein after the advancements of Quantum Theory - a theoretical framework which although \\rextraordinarily powerful leading to all sorts of amazing and revolutionary scientific advancements, \\rnonetheless forces us to look very hard and close at the principles of causal determinism and objective \\rrealism not just as underlying theories for Physics, but also as theoretical assumptions regarding the nature \\rof the world we live in, as an ontological paradigm no less. Since the introduction and acceptance of Quantum Theory, we have been exposed to a variety of intellectual \\rparadigms intended to explain how these seemingly contradictory worlds, Classical Mechanics and Quantum \\rTheory, can both be true at the same time - the many worlds interpretation for example, or Bohmian \\rMechanics which has given us this notion of holomovement and implicate order. Furthermore, these \\rdevelopments in Physics have interestingly led to many proponents of Eastern philosophy to look at some of \\rthe underlying foundational precepts of Quantum Theory - locality being perhaps the most prominent of \\rthese - as consistent with their ontology, the world as an expression of divine consciousness where the \\rsystem as a whole informs local events as it were.\\n\\nWe also have at the same time, due in no small measure to globalization and technological advancements \\rever since the beginning of the 20th century really, seen the spread of Eastern philosophical traditions, mostly \\rin the form of Yoga, throughout the world, beyond the classically \"Eastern\" borders, having now become \\ralmost ubiquitous in the West. While the driver of this spread is arguably mostly materialistic, i.e. an \\robsession with the body and health, the search for the extension of life and well-being, the philosophical as \\rwell as theological implications of this diffusion of worldviews is significant. For one, the Eastern worldview is not foreign to most people in the West now as it was say at the beginning \\rof the Quantum Era before WWII, and second the idea of an underlying, active consciousness from which \\rboth the mind and the physical world manifest, and in turn rest or depend upon for existence, is not a \\rcompletely foreign or outrageous concept to those who have been exposed to these Eastern philosophical \\rtraditions, despite the fact that this notion has for the most part been rejected by the Scientific community.\\n\\nAlso, while the rational foundations of Religion, theology, has been under attack since the Scientific \\rRevolution more or less, now with the proliferation of Yoga and Buddhism and other forms of Eastern \\rphilosophy, which integrate theology and metaphysics, along with very specific spiritual practices like \\rmeditation, in order to facilitate and demonstrate the underlying ontological truth of said theological belief \\rsystems, Religion - at least in the West - is becoming not only an endangered species but is looked upon \\ralmost as barbaric in a way, as we see for example in how Islam is viewed in particular which has become \\rvery closely associated with radical extremism, i.e. Terrorism. These trends have not only metaphysical and theological implications, but also moral and ethical ones as \\rwell. A further attack on the religious establishment while (superficially) many may not have a problem with, \\rand many in the atheist community especially directly espouse, leads us to the very precarious position again \\ras to the basis of, and fundamental attributes of, morality and ethics. The problem effectively runs across a variety of intellectual lines but, like alcoholism or drug addiction or any \\rproblem for that matter, the first step to solving said problem is recognizing that there is in fact a problem.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear that we as a global community have reached that conclusion yet - not just for each of the \\rindividual problems we have laid out, but even the level of crisis that we are at given the scope of all of the \\rproblems put together. Having said that, certainly a step in the right direction is to try and establish the proper and appropriate \\rintellectual framework out of which the solutions to these problems - each of them individually and then the \\rgroup of them collectively - at least have the potential of being solved. Because while these problems are on \\ra scale that we have yet to encounter in the history of mankind, they still nonetheless require action at the \\rindividual level in order for us to at least have a fighting chance to solve them. Politics is local as they say. Furthermore, given the scale of some of these issues and their inherent complexity, socio-political structures \\rneed to be established that again have the appropriate intellectual paradigm or worldview such that the \\rproblems can be attacked and addressed at the nation-state and global level - a two-pronged approach as it \\rwere.\\n\\nFrom the author\\'s point of view at least, in order to establish the proper and appropriate intellectual \\rframework we must truly recognize - from an epistemological perspective - that the underlying ground of \\rexistence, what we have called supraconsciousness, is not just some ethereal thing that a few crazy mystics \\ror sages have experienced and some folks have written a book about. That this whole \"the kingdom of God \\ris within\" message from the son of a carpenter some two thousand years ago, and the countless other \\rmessages from saints and prophets throughout the ages, is not just a bunch of hog wash. Anything less than \\rthis, anything that is purely empirically or rationally based that does not have any theological implications, \\rsimply does not go far enough, or deep enough, to address some, or perhaps all, of these issues. God - if he does indeed exist - needs to be placed on former, more realistic, footing such that morality and \\rthe social good in and of itself is not a \"liberal\" or philosophical idea, but is the most practical of rational \\rdeductions that is based upon the fundamental understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings - \\ragain not on just an intellectual or ethereal level, but on a practical and very grounded level as reflected in \\rthe \"mystical\" experience as it is understood by the Eastern philosophical traditions.\\n\\nAnd if he does not exist, \\rwell then off he goes into the intellectual and metaphysical trashbin, forcing us to construct an intellectual \\rparadigm based on need within the context of the crises of our time rather than due to any theological \\rcertainty. Either path represents a necessary condition for us to make it successfully through the crisis of our \\rtime and move beyond it, given the scale and complexity of these challenges and threats that are confronting \\rus. To get there, in terms of providing and informing the rest of the disciplines that will need to be brought to \\rbear on these problems, we must start with Philosophy - determining to what extent if at all can these \\rmystical frameworks that are buried into the collective mythos of man can be laid out in a pure rational \\rmodel, as required by Philosophy as a discipline in and of itself in modern academia. As opposed to starting \\rwith the assumption that there exists a divine being, i.e. God, from which the universe - and us - have been \\rcreated which is no doubt fraught with problems. But the problem is more difficult than it appears, the decks are stacked against us as it were, because even \\rthe very description of the problem is tainted with the problem. We live in a fundamentally dualistic world \\rwhere that which is perceived and the perceiver are forever separated by a veneer of objectivity.\\n\\nThe \\rsubject-object-metaphysical presumption of reality, as expressed in the full range of epistemological solutions \\rthat have been provided over the millennia, is baked into the very semantics of our language making it \\ralmost impossible to break free from. This is why Pirsig felt the need to come up with an almost indefinable word, a word indefinable by nature, \\rthat sits above the whole intellectual paradigm, in order to try and capture it in some way, i.e. Quality. This \\rwas the same solution that the ancient mystics of the East came up with as well of course, using words like \\rthe Dao, or Brahman, to reflect that which was undefinable, and to a large extent even unknowable, but yet \\rat the same time played a profound role in the creation and preservation of the universe and all life within it. As an example, if look at ontology as a Philosophical discipline, one of the dominant undercurrent themes of \\rthis work of course, and one of the more active and thriving fields within Philosophy today - we find implicit \\rwithin the word, the discipline, itself, this same objective paradigm of existence that we are trying to move \\raway from. - ontology is the science of, or study of, being or reality - but by whom? If there is a verb, there \\rmust be an actor against it, and presumably - although less restrictively - an object as well.\\n\\nThis is in fact an \\rIndo-European linguistic construct - subject verb object - providing a tremendously powerful intellectual tool \\rthrough which we can not only explore our reality, our world - describe it, articulate it, improve upon it, etc. - \\rbut also persist information and knowledge itself so that the sum total of knowledge is carried forward from \\rone generation to the next with a high degree of specificity. Almost relentlessly though, subject-object-metaphysics is embedded into not just our intellectual framework, \\rbut even our linguistic framework as well, leaving us with a classical chick and egg problem as it were. Once \\rthat linguistic invention is applied, we are left with the foregone conclusion that our worldview must be \\rreductionist - it has to be, because that is the only way we can express anything, in any Indo-European \\rlanguage really, the language family that that has provided the linguistic, and effectively the intellectual, \\rfoundations of the West. Every time you try and solve it you go further down the rabbit hole as it were.\\n\\nThis is why in order to solve the problem, bridge this intellectual divide as it were, one is almost forced to \\rrevert back to the initial theo-philosophical solutions that were presented by the very first philosophers in \\rthe West, by Plato, Aristotle, and others that were the forefathers of Western philosophy, as well as in the \\rEastern traditions as well such as in the Upanishads in the Indian tradition, which although are still hamstrung \\rwith this subject-object-metaphysical worldview that is baked into their language, nonetheless made \\rprovisions for this fundamental unified, holistic, monistic, mystical, supra-intellectual, supraconscious \\rconstruct, to be described somehow. This was the Being of the early Hellenic philosophical tradition (Plato \\rprimarily), the One of the Neo-Platonists, and the Satcitānanda (or somewhat anthropomorphized Brahman) \\rof the Upanishads. So linguistically then, we are almost forced to go back to the very foundations of theology, metaphysics \\rreally, in order to connect this very ancient notion of God as an integral aspect of his creation - God is \\reverything, God is in everything and as such is the ground of all experience and in turn is the (intellectual as \\rwell as physical and spiritual) ground of experience in and of itself - this is essentially what we find in \\rUpanishadic philosophy as Satcitānanda and in the West is reflected perhaps most eloquently in the Neo-\\rPlatonic One.\\n\\nIn these initial intellectual systems, the philosophia of the West, although the semantic structure was laid \\rdown as a function of the Indo-European subject and object based linguistic constructs, effectively the \\rfoundations Western thought, of Science, these ancient systems nonetheless did not carry the same sort of \\rreductionist emphasis that we are confronted with today, as they are seen reflected in the mirror of Science \\ras it were, after Philosophy as a discipline split between natural and theoretical lines. This takes us to the ancient Hellenes once again, with Plato primarily as the perhaps the first metaphysician \\rand theologian, although certainly not the first philosopher. Despite his rational bent, he still nonetheless \\rcaptured in a way that ancient mystical quality that is characteristic of the Paleolithic religions throughout \\rEurasia which preceded him - what we refer to quite broadly as shamanism. This mystic quality is again best \\rcaptured in the Platonic philosophy of Plotinus, the quintessential Neo-Platonist - his doctrine of the One \\rwhich manifests itself, via emanation of sorts, into the many by way of the Divine Intellect, or Nous. Neo-\\rPlatonism from a mystical and theological standpoint in fact is eerily similar to its Indo-European brother on \\rthe Indian subcontinent, the philosophy we find implicit to the Upanishads which forms the basis of Vedānta.\\n\\nHere we find the notion of the single, divine principle as well, referred to as Brahman, a metaphysical \\rabstraction of Brahmā, the creator of the universe in the Vedic mythos - minus the numerological significance \\rinherent to the Neo-Platonic One of course, one of the distinctive features of Hellenic philosophy. Then, \\rthrough the cosmic ordering principle of Ṛta, which comes to be understood in the later Indian philosophical \\rtradition - and Buddhism - as dharma, the cosmos is brought into existence, corresponding quite elegantly to \\rthe Neo-Platonic Nous, a sort of Divine Intellect that is rational, i.e. reflects a sense of order, but at the same \\rtime is intelligent in the sense that it reflects a being of some kind, something that is \"alive\". Furthermore, in both Neo-Platonism as well as with Upanishadic philosophy (as well as with Christianity as \\rwell in fact) we find this all-pervading cosmic principle reflected in the individual in the notion of the Soul, the \\rlast of the great triad of metaphysical and theological constructs in Plotinus\\'s interpretation of Plato which \\rcorresponds again quite neatly to the Upanishadic Ātman, the individual manifestation of Brahman through \\rwhich his (or her) creation is experienced.\\n\\nImplicit in this characteristically Indo-European theo-philosophy is \\rthat man is created, or exists, in the image of God - one of the fundamental Indo-European theological tenets \\rin fact and one which we can see implicit in the Upanishads, but also embedded in virtually all of Hellenic \\rphilosophy as well which in turn forms the basis of Judeo-Christian theology. In the Chinese tradition, they are somewhat less hamstrung, and came up with the notion of Dao, which is \\rmore process (change really) based than it is based upon any sort of subject, or object, or experience. It\\'s a \\rway, a path, an experiential process of \"living\", of \"being\". The metaphysics of the Yìjīng supports this as the \\rDao, as a theo-philosophical principle or tenet, runs almost orthogonal to the Yìjīng when looked at through a \\rmetaphysical or philosophical lens. From this perspective, the Yìjīng not only describes Fate itself, but also \\rprovides a framework for coaxing out of it potential future outcomes given a) a totality of possible states of \\r\"being\", and b) knowledge of the relationship of these states to one another, and c) an identification of the \\rcurrent state of \"being\" that best describes the current \"situation\" as it relates to the total possible set of \\rstates of possible existence.\\n\\nThis is the power of the Chinese theo-philosophical framework, it doesn\\'t try and solve an epistemological \\r\"problem\", or even a metaphysical one, but it does present (at least one possible) ontological solution, as \\rwell as - quite ingeniously - a means by which one can have dialogue with It. \"It\" in this case being the \\rprimordial ontological system itself within which you as an experiential, process and change based entity that \\rsits within the Earth-Heaven-Man paradigm of universal order exist. This is why the Eastern philosophical systems in particular have become so appealing, because - in their \\rinherent language which reflects their worldview - the reductionist ontology is (almost) entirely effaced - it \\rhas no room to exist. The entire vocabulary of the systems in question require you to abandon it. And it is \\rwith the language, the vocabulary itself, that the solution really shows itself, manifests as it were. It is \\rtherefore along these lines we must look, to the very first philosophical systems that were created in \\rantiquity, to the very origins of philosophy in ancient times, because it is at the very beginning of the \\restablishment of the philosophical tradition that we have our best chance, in terms of vocabulary and model, \\rto re-integrate that which was lost when we went down the reductionist and materialist path through and via \\rScience.\\n\\nBut these ancient philosophical systems, which are just as much theological as they are philosophical of \\rcourse, despite their power in integrating the so-called mystical directly into the philosophical framework as \\rit were, nonetheless are lacking in terms of - given the time period within which they emerged and were \\rdeveloped - integrating the last millennia or so of intellectual developments, as reflected specifically for \\rexample in the domain of Science, i.e. Physics as it has evolved through the Copernican revolution, \\rNewtonian Mechanics and then most recently with Quantum Mechanics. They also of course do not address the philosophical advancements that have run in parallel to these \\radvancements on the empirical side as reflected most poignantly by Kant, whose work effectively integrates \\rthe empiricist (materialist) and rationalist (idealists) philosophical schools that had evolved and countered \\reach other since the very dawn of philosophy, civilization really, in the West. Kant gets us a little closer from a metaphysical standpoint, directly integrating experience into philosophy as \\rthe very ground of epistemology. But God in Kant\\'s philosophy is an intellectual construct, a necessary \\rcondition of his Metaphysics of Morals, but nonetheless not the ontological penultimate principle in any way.\\n\\nTo Kant, it is Reason that is the benchmark of truth, Reason as an abstract construct that exists within, and is \\rultimately bound and defined by, mankind\\'s ability to perceive or understand, i.e. cognate. Kant\\'s \\repistemology is fundamentally Psychological, and therefore his metaphysics is Psychological just as much as it \\ris rational. Figure 41: Neo-Metaphysics: A Modern, Synthetic Theo-Philosophical Perspective\\r\\rAt first the work was an attempt to define a new metaphysics, but in order to do this successfully, a new \\repistemological framework is required - a new model with new semantics that integrates the notion of the \\rdirect experience of God as, if possible, a firm element of truth from which in fact all truth, all knowledge, \\rstems from. While Pirsig\\'s Metaphysics of Quality hints at a new ontology, his new paradigm based upon the metaphysical \\rnotion of Quality doesn\\'t truly integrate the mystical experience in a meaningful way. While it\\'s present, it\\'s \\ralmost an afterthought given the focus of his work on the metaphysics of value really, from which a broader \\rand more encompassing system of morality can effectively be inferred. But while it\\'s an extraordinarily \\rpowerful model no doubt, arguably revolutionizing metaphysics and Philosophy, it\\'s an altogether Western \\rparadigm from a theological standpoint, even if it is not reductionist, or at least partially reductionist, in its \\rhierarchical structure.\\n\\nLooking at the problem from a further level of abstraction as it were, it would seem that a requisite step \\ralong the path toward a resolution, or at least an amelioration, of some of these issues that are reflective of \\rthe proliferation of this characteristically Western ideology taken to the extreme (not sufficient but \\rnecessary) would be to try and establish a more firm metaphysical structure, a new ontological paradigm, \\rwithin which this characteristically Eastern philosophical notion of mysticism could be integrated with \\rWestern philosophy, with Reason really. In other words, it would seem that what we have is a philosophical problem, in the sense that there must be \\rsomething fundamentally missing from our basic core intellectual paradigm through which not only individual \\rdecisions are being made, but also on a grander scale at the sociological as well as political level, such that we \\rare ending up with problems on the scale that we have today, continually reinforcing the challenges and \\rproblems that effectively define the current era of crisis that we are in - the so-called Quantum Era.\\n\\nFurthermore, at a more detailed level staying within the domain of Philosophy, it\\'s an ontological problem in \\rthe sense that it is some higher order of reality that is required in order to explain the full range of \\rphenomenon - phenomenon in this sense as not just physical phenomenon (objective reality), not just \\rpsychological phenomenon (subjective reality), and not just experiential reality, but a reality within which \\rexperience itself can take place as a phenomenon in itself. It\\'s an epistemological problem in the sense that \\rour current notions of knowledge - how a thing can be known as well as the inverse which is effectively how \\rwe define \"the world\", or at least \"the world that can be known\" - are again wholly inadequate for the job at \\rhand.\\n\\nTo put it succinctly, what we need here is an epistemological paradigm that contains within it the full range of \\rphenomenon, the expansion of the notion of phenomenon in fact, to include not just the physical (the \\robjective reality of the materialists and the empiricists like Aristotle, Epicurus, Bacon and Locke among \\rothers), and not just the rational (the idealistic and rationalistic reality Plato, Descartes and Leibniz for \\rexample), and not just the psychological or experiential which subsumes both (like Kant for example - or even \\rFreud or Jung), but a reality that describes all of the above within a paradigm that is \\ra)\\tphilosophical in the sense that it is fully rational, \\rb)\\tmetaphysical in the sense that it is supra-physical and\\n\\nsupra-rational and covers the range of \\rphenomena which includes things and ideas, \\rc)\\ttheological in the sense that first principles, arche, are fully integrated (rather than left outside of it \\ras defining attributes or characteristics like categories for example in the philosophy of Aristotle and \\rKant) \\r\\rIf this is possible, if we can maintain consistency, rationality and coherence and still achieve these three \\rgoals, we can achieve much in terms of establishing an ontological and metaphysical paradigm that rests on \\rmuch broader and firm ground, and increasing its applicability beyond just the domain of Philosophy such \\rthat it can provide an intellectual foundation for mankind to tackle some of these great challenges it is faced \\rwith. Thankfully we do not have to recreate the wheel to in order to try and formulate a more global and holistic \\rintellectual paradigm through which we at least have a chance to address some of these persistent and global \\rproblems that are so characteristics of our time, i.e. the so-called \"Quantum Era\". Most of the groundwork has been put in place already by Kant, although his framework stops just short of \\rwhat we need.\\n\\nKant\\'s philosophy is revolutionary in the sense that he is able to integrate the reality of the \\rrationalists and empiricists in one metaphysical system, and he does this by inverting the classical ontological \\rparadigm, declaring that knowledge is only how we may perceive it through our cognitive faculties and that \\rno other definition of it - either empirically or rationally - stands to Reason, quite literally. In his own words \\r(translated from the German of course)\\r\\rIf we take away the subject (Humans), or even only the subjective constitution of our senses in general, then not \\ronly the nature and relations of objects in space and time, but even space and time themselves disappear; and \\rthat these, as appearances, cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What may be the nature of objects \\rconsidered as things in themselves and without reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quite unknown \\rto us. ... not only are the raindrops mere appearances, but even their circular form, nay, the space itself through \\rwhich they fall, is nothing in itself, but both are mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensible \\rintuition, whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterly unknown. This is his Copernican revolution of philosophy, that objective phenomenon and their relations, and even \\rspace and time in and of themselves, are fundamentally psychological phenomenon.\\n\\nTo this extent, Kant and \\rPirsig follow similar lines, going back to the beginning as it were, where Reason is considered to be the \\rprimordial and most fundamental principle under which all domains of knowledge should be conceived and \\ras such establish their respective systems of metaphysics on the basis of this principle alone - i.e. Reason. Reason in this sense is not only considered to be the distinguishing characteristic of man (homo sapiens after \\rall) - that which separates it from the rest of the species on the planet - but one which, according to virtually \\revery theo-philosophical tradition that has been created since civilized man has existed or been known to \\rexist, is the very connecting or linking principle which is the common thread between man and the divine. It is Reason that is the means by which man is created in God\\'s image as is expressed so eloquently in the \\rJudeo-Christian tradition, i.e. the Logos, and it is of course implied in the Eastern theo-philosophical \\rtraditions in toto as it is this belief in the fundamental unity of man as a spiritual being, as a rational being, \\rthat gives it the unique disposition and capability to experience the divine directly. It is the cosmic Reason \\rthat in turn orders the universe, the Neo-Platonic Nous through which the universe is born and is \\rsustained.\\n\\nBut Kant\\'s work, more specifically his Critique as it is called, is considered to represent the very height of \\rEnlightenment Era philosophy and as such let\\'s begin there, taking his philosophy, his metaphysics more \\rspecifically, as a given rather than starting from scratch (and/or immediately irritating all of our Kantian \\rphilosophers out there and I would expect there are many). But before we begin let us say that our goal here \\ris explicitly NOT the full exposition, comprehension or elucidation of Kant\\'s philosophy - there are endless \\rcourses, teachers and other forums for such exercises. What we intend to do, what we are doing, is leveraging his work so that we need not re-invent the wheel so \\rto speak from a metaphysical point of view. Let\\'s take his position, his transcendental idealism as it has come \\rto be known, as valid and true, and perhaps more importantly rationally coherent and complete and identify \\rwhat about said systemn, given what we know now, is incomplete or lacking. This is effectively how mankind has developed knowledge throughout his history, not by going over tracks \\rand modes or ways of thought over again that have been walked by our ancestors, but presuming the \\rcoherence, and fundamental utility, of said work and in turn - where appropriate and/or necessary - building \\rupon such work.\\n\\nPhilosophy somehow seems bent on re-inventing everything every generation however, \\rand as such deters from its ability to persist, and impress, upon the minds of each ensuing generation. Like \\rfor example the network stack upon which the Internet is built. Those that develop Internet applications do \\rnot have to understand how it is that machines on the Internet exchange traffic, information essentially, \\rthese programs simply inherit, leverage really, libraries and APIs (application programming interfaces) that \\rencapsulate such knowledge. This is effectively what we are doing here, building upon Kant\\'s work so that we need not re-invent it, but at \\rthe same time expanding upon it because there are things we know today, that are relevant and important \\rtoday with respect to metaphysics and ontology specifically, that were not of relevance when Kant lived, \\rstudied and wrote. This is how human knowledge moves forward, in particular as it relates to highly complex \\rtopics, problems, like what we are confronted with here.\\n\\nTaking Kant\\'s metaphysics as our starting point then, his ontological first principle is of course the human \\rmind, an entity that Kant effectively equates with a cognitive engine of sorts through which all knowledge of \\rany sort is or can be gained - a priori knowledge being a specific type of knowledge that is unique to this \\rcognitive entity, like time and space, which represent not basic objective or rational phenomena that exist in \\rand of themselves, but phenomena that exist as a function of the mind and its cognitive capabilities. To Kant \\rthen, and this is fundamental to his epistemological position, knowledge is bound by (human) experience. According to Kant\\'s Critique, the human mind basically has three basic functions for arriving at knowledge of \\ranything, as much as knowledge can be arrived at. While we use Kant\\'s \"epistemic\" framework, we adopt a \\rmore modern psychological description herein for each of the three faculties that Kant presented as \\rproperties of mind that (hopefully) are easier to understand (no pun intended), slightly adapting the \\rterminology that Kant uses which is translated from the German over 200 years ago.\\n\\nIn his mental cognitive framework, there are basically three distinct faculties which in aggregate make up the \\rtotal function of mind as a cognitive, epistemic entity which can arrive at the knowledge of anything:\\ri.\\tperception (Kant\\'s sensibility): that aspect of mind that directly interfaces with and/or perceives \\rthe sensible realm, i.e. the physical world, \\rii. comprehension (Kant\\'s understanding and imagination): that aspect of mind which works with \\rthe faculty of perception to make sense of that which is being experienced. While it is a rational \\rfaculty, it does not operate on the same level of rational abstraction as understanding, \\riii. understanding (Kant\\'s judgment or reason): that faculty of mind that is capable of fully \\rintellectually absorbing the meaning of an experience, applying various higher level intellectual \\rparadigms - sociological, philological, biological, etc. - to an experience through which a deeper \\rlevel of meaning, or purpose, relative to comprehension certainly, can be acquired. According to Kant then, it is through these cognitive faculties - either individually or collectively - that man is \\rable to make sense of anything, by which sensory input is integrated with mind given its various cognitive \\rfaculties.\\n\\nIt is from this basic framework from which not only does Kant construct his practical philosophy, his \\rMetaphysics of Morals, but also from which he establishes the requisite existence of God, and its close \\rcorollary the immortality of the Soul, as deduced preconditions of mankind as a function of him (or her) being \\ra rational being as it were, as byproducts of mind effectively. Kant\\'s Critique certainly solves many, if not all, of the questions and issues that were of concern during the \\rEnlightenment Era with respect to (what Kant considered) the radical forms of both empiricism and \\rrationalism that were prevalent (and yielded metaphysical conundrums such as that nothing could be known \\rfor example), as well as the very shaky ground that theology in general was on, begging some serious \\rquestions regarding the justification for morality or ethics at all. What Kant leaves out however, and this is not surprising given the problem(s) he is looking to solve (a \\rdifferent era no doubt, where the relevance of Eastern philosophy, and more generally mysticism, were not \\rquestions that were of concern in Philosophy at that time) is from what metaphysical or ontological ground is \\rthis experience occurring, or are these cognitive faculties working? Put another way, from what principle are \\rthe cognitive faculties, man and mind essentially, derived from?\\n\\nA Kantian would no doubt argue that this question is of no consequence epistemologically as all knowing, all \\rknowledge itself, is a process of apprehension based upon sensory experience combined with perception \\r(aesthetics) and comprehension and understanding as pure cognitive facilties (logic) - at least according to \\rKant. But what we\\'re looking for is a system of metaphysics to allow us to navigate, philosophically, through \\rreality - upon which a system of cognition, and epistemology (and ontology) can be based. Kant is not so much concerned with this exercise as he yields to an empricial realist position more or less - \\rexpanding the position somewhat to include a pirori concepts such as time and space which allow for the \\rinclusion of classically rationalist epistemological positions to be satisified with his so-called transcendental \\ridealism - but bounded the notion of knowledge itself within the confines of the mind, and cognition, \\reffectively. A case could be made that this question is irrelevant within Kant\\'s metaphysics given the boundaries within \\rwhich he ascribes to knowledge itself - that it is bound by experience, by the empirical even if it is wed in \\rsome strange way to a priori, intuitive concepts such as space and time.\\n\\nNothing can be said to be truly \\rknown without not only the ground of experience itself (which again he leaves out of his metaphysics), but \\ralso again without a subjective, embodied experiencer of said experience through which knowledge in any \\rform is possible. What is overlooked then, and perhaops this is not surprising, is the the implicit spatial, time and embodiment \\rconstraints that encase the entire cognitive, epistemological framework. Within the context of objective \\rrealism, which was the predominant ontological perspective of the era in question, perhaps almost best \\rrepresented by Kant himself. While he bridged the gap between rationalism and empiricism quite elegantly, \\rhe pushes the predominant worldview into his transcendental background and then calls these assumptions \\ra priori. To put it succinctly, what is the source or intellectual ground of Kant\\'s cognitive framework? From whence it \\rcame and from whence does its cognitive capabilities, its reasoning capacity really, originate or derive \\rfrom? Whether or not Kant would deem it a relevant question is of no heed for our argument here, which \\ris essentially that Western philosophy is so deeply steeped in objective realism that it lacks the metaphysical \\rstructure to incorporate and ultimately adequately explain, the nature of experience - being is what the \\rancients called it - itself.\\n\\nWhat we are left with, from a metaphysical perspective, is the quite elementary conclusion that there must \\rbe some ground for the process of cognition itself, from which a human being (or any thinking animal for that \\rmatter) derives its intelligence so to speak, from which its cognitive capabilities are sourced from, and \\rperhaps most importantly to which the cognitive act is defined relative to. For again to speak of cognition as the defining feature of man, to construct an epistemological framework \\rthat is mind driven rather than (transcendental) reality driven so to speak (that things exist in and of \\rthemselves regardless as to whether or not they are perceived by anyone or anything), we must have some \\rsort of metaphysical ground within which this cognitive engine, this rational entity, exists and/or to which \\rthis act of cognition exists relative to. The fact that Kant is more concerned with establishing definitive, and \\robjectively and empirically focused, boundaries of knowledge itself is - at least for the purposes of our work - \\rrevealing in its inherent focus on the objective, empirically based and physical sciences as the basis for \\rPhilosophy, rather than the other way around which is how Aristotle designed his system of philsoohy and \\rmost certaionly how we are (re)construicting ours here (following Arisitotle).\\n\\nThis is an absolutely critical point and one that on its face seems obvious, and one again that would be \\rdiscounted from an epistemological perspective by Kant given the boundaries of knowledge that he sets \\rforth, but a point that is nonetheless pivotal with respect to the task at hand that looks to transform Kant\\'s \\rphilosophy, expanding it really, such that it is capable of absorbing, subsuming and incorporating \\rsupraconsciousness as we define it herein, as well as its close cousin Jung\\'s collective unconscious. Both these \\rstates of being, states of consciousness, are not tied to an embodied form and as such lie outside of Kantian\\'s \\rboundary of knowledge. What we are suggesting here is that not that his system is wrong or invalid, in fact quite the contrary. We are \\rarguing that his system is the most cohesive and rationally founded system of philosophy in the modern era \\rbut that it is - like the way Einstein described Quantum Mechanics when it was first described - incomplete. As such,m it requires a metaphysical extension as it were in order for it to fully encapsulate the entire \\rbreadth of human experience as it is understood in the postmodern era, evolving along with Psychology and \\rPhysics to adapt to more collective, holistic and aggregate modes of understanding the human experience \\rand the knowledge acaquired therein.\\n\\nThe implication here, and this is profound - and in some sense is itself a rational deduction which in and of \\ritself is ironic in a way - is that Reason itself is bound and constrained, and that in order to account for \\rmysticism, or God really, in any sort of intellectual framework, any sort of ideological system, we must move \\rbeyond Reason given said constraints of the tool at hand. Therefore, in order to create an ontological \\rframework which accounts for, and describes in any sort of meaningful way, ideas that are fundamentally \\rsupra-rational, i.e. God as reflected in fundamentally mystical states of consciousness or being, we must, \\ragain as a rational deduction of sorts, establish a system that subsumes Reason itself. Having established the need for a requisite metaphysical or ontological principle within which Kant\\'s \\repistemological framework - again Reason or mind - must be subsumed, by which its existence itself must \\rultimately depend, we then are faced with the task of determining or describing what qualities said \\rontological principle should, or must, have. But first we shall give it a name.\\n\\nWe shall call this primordial \\rmetaphysical principle upon which both Kant\\'s theoretical and practical philosophy rests \"awareness\", \\ralluding to the fact that this metaphysical construct requires some sort of consciousness, or other quality of \\rbeing or existence, such that the cognitive process itself which Kant\\'s system of metaphysics, or epistemology \\ris constructed upon, can be active, alive and essentially aware, giving it its cognitive properties in a way. Awareness then as we understand it, is the necessary (precognitive) dependent metaphysical principle from \\rwhich cognition in any form must depend upon in order for it, i.e. the act of cognition, to have any \\repistemological validity at all. Awareness is not a cognitive faculty, it\\'s the necessary condition of cognition \\ritself - lying in a sense underneath, or ontologically prior to, these faculties of the mind which according to \\rKant facilitate, bound, knowledge of any kind, through the process of cognition. In other words, our knowledge of anything at all is not just as a result of cognition alone, as Kant professes, \\rbut as a result of the entire metaphysical, ontological and epistemological framework upon which both the \\rknowledge of said thing depends, and the cognitive framework within which said knowledge is gained or \\racquired as the case may be. This underlying intellectual structure or paradigm, i.e.\\n\\nour awareness, is \\reffectively baked into the cognitive process, implied in a fundamental way, working at a level that is much \\rgrander and global - from an ontological perspective - than understanding, which is a \"local\" construct in the \\rsense that it is bound by the individual psyche or conscious mind of the person undergoing the experience. Awareness operates at a much broader metaphysical perspective and vantage point, not only providing the \\rground of the cognitive experience, but also bringing to bear certain global, larger order intellectual construct \\rupon experience itself, contributing to the knowledge that is gained as part of the cognitive process in a way \\rthat is more profound than understanding. Borrowing Cognitive Science and Computer Science terminology, if we think of Kant\\'s mind, the psyche, as a \\rstate machine of sorts (a theoretical construct akin to the Turing machine in Computer Science which is a \\rtheoretical model for any computer system) we can think of the faculties of understanding and \\rcomprehension as providing analytical, synthesizing, categorizing or any other type of process based \\rfunctional algorithm capabilities to the cognitive process, resulting in a change of the properties of said \\rsubject - the \"state\" in the state-machine.\\n\\nThis process, this act of cognition, is dependent upon, or operates \\ras a function of, attributes or qualities that are specific to the individual entity or being that is \"cognizing\", as \\rconceived of through perception. Awareness however, does more than just provide the metaphysical grounding of the experience (even \\rthough this in and of itself is absolutely critical to the cognitive process, to the extent that cognition, or again \\rmore generally experience, would not occur without it) it acts as a global aggregate construct that \\rencapsulates the experience from a psychological perspective, a collective frame of reference within which \\rexperience, the act of cognition, is processed through which the result of cognition, i.e. knowledge, is realized \\r- using Aristotle\\'s terminology the actualizing principle of knowledge. Understanding and Awareness then, \\rsimilar to the faculties of perception and comprehension, work together to provide the psychological \\rgrounding of the experience. Awareness then, rounds out Kant\\'s metaphysics, providing it with the \\rmetaphysical and psychological infrastructure for cognition as a knowledge creating, or acquiring, process. With Awareness added to Kant\\'s metaphysical, and ultimately epistemological, framework, we have \\restablished a new metaphysical paradigm which contains, or is dependent upon, an ontological primordial \\rprinciple - i.e. Awareness.\\n\\nAs such, we have established a higher order metaphysical system, or ontological \\rparadigm, a Metaphysics of Awareness, which although rests upon Kantian philosophical foundations, \\rprovides us with a more complete intellectual paradigm within which mind, as an ontological entity through \\rwhich knowledge is gained or acquired, can be more fully understood and appreciated and through which \\rhigher order principles such as God or supraconsciousness can be more readily explained, from an \\repistemological perspective. Our Metaphysics of Awareness suggests, requires really, that there must be a ground of being or Awareness, \\rthat must exist in order for any experience or act of cognition to occur, and in turn for any form of knowledge \\rto be acquired or gained as a result of said experience of act of cognition. As such, this Awareness must be a \\rreal thing, an epistemological entity in the sense that without it, the cognitive process from which knowledge \\rin any form is derived, is incomplete. Therefore, as a prerequisite component of the process by which \\rknowledge is gained or arrived at, Awareness must in turn be an ontological entity in and of itself, a \\rfundamental component of the cognitive process by which knowledge is bound or defined in the abstract, \\rmetaphysical sense.\\n\\nThe Metaphysics of Awareness then, can and should be understood as a logical \\rextension of Kant\\'s metaphysics which establishes mind as the ontological primordial principle within which \\rknowledge must be defined in relation to, providing the metaphysical ground for Reason itself, as reflected in \\rthe cognitive process, something Kant does not account for in any meaningful way. Furthermore, Awareness provides a collective, aggregate metaphysical construct to the cognitive process \\rthat not only provides a global context to experience, it also informs the cognitive process itself, reflecting a \\rfeedback look of sorts that connects the discrete experience with the psyche as an abstract and continuous \\rentity or being, defined as the aggregate or sum total of all experiences that it has undergone since its \\rinception. In this context, we can understand awareness as Pirsig\\'s Dynamic Quality, what he calls \"pure \\rawareness\" which represents the very forefront of experience, in its most \"raw\" form, prior to the \\rapplication of any sort of intellectual paradigm (Pirsig\\'s static Quality, which denotes the intellectual \\rparadigm through which experience is processed and ultimately \"understood\") or any act of cognition. Awareness is not a purely rational faculty however, in fact it\\'s not really a faculty per se as it sits orthogonal \\rto the process of cognition, while again informing it and providing the metaphysical ground for the \\rexperience to occur.\\n\\nIn this context, Awareness is supra-rational, working with symbols and levels of \\rabstraction - Platonic forms almost - that do not have the linear, black and white qualities that are \\rcharacteristic of the faculties of comprehension or understanding for example, cognitive faculties that apply - \\ragain using our Cognitive and Computer Science analogy - more linear algorithms of grouping, sorting, \\rattribute and quality determination, etc. Awareness provides the supra-rational ground as it were, through \\rwhich the act of cognition, experience, occurs through which knowledge is manifest and vy which it comes to \\rbe defined. Awareness as a complementary component of the cognitive process provides the symbolic \\rground within which experience, i.e. knowledge, is absorbed - aggregated and crystallized you might say - \\rproviding the psychological contextual framework and infrastructure within which the cognitive process can \\relicit meaning from some sensory or rational inputs above and beyond the fairly straightforward process of \\rcategorization or classification which is the mainstay of Kant\\'s faculties of comprehension and understanding \\rprimarily. In this sense, we have now established within the metaphysical model itself, i.e.\\n\\nthe Metaphysics \\rof Awareness, a psychological repository as it were for not just intellectual paradigms - social or linguistic \\rframeworks for example - but for Jungian archetypes, a sort of a priori knowledge that while it is not tied to \\rany object or rational paradigm necessarily, is nonetheless social or human focused in its content and shape. What we are doing here to Kant\\'s cognitive process, his epistemological framework, is effectively quantizing \\rit. That is to say the Metaphysics of Awareness  is a metaphysical paradigm that is arrived at via the process \\rof applying quantum like principles or features to the prevailing epistemological paradigm in Philosophy, a \\rparadigm that is intrinsically \"Classical\" - in the sense that modern Western philosophy, as established by \\rKant primarily, considers knowledge to be a fundamentally \"classical\" concept - i.e. it\\'s a discrete, measurable \\rand quantifiable entity that is the result of a very specific and well defined cognitive process.\\n\\nWith the \\rMetaphysics of Awareness, we\\'ve added a metaphysical construct to Kant\\'s epistemological framework, \\rAwareness, that brings fundamentally quantum like features to the model, after which knowledge can be \\rconceived of both as an individualized and discrete \"thing\" in and of itself, and also at the same time be \\rdefined more holistically as a result of the (mental) processes of perception, comprehension and \\runderstanding complemented or augmented by Awareness which brings \"non-local\" attributes and qualities \\rto the experience via its grounding, and meta-defining in a way, function in the cognitive framework itself.\\n\\nIn other words, now that Awareness has been added as an ontological primordial metaphysical principle to \\rKant\\'s epistemological framework, we have effectively quantized Kant\\'s epistemological framework in that \\rnow knowledge is no longer just a discrete metaphysical or intellectual construct that is the result of a well-\\rdefined, linear process, but it can be (more properly and completely) conceived of as a multi-tiered or multi-\\rdimensional principle that while undoubtedly is rooted in the sensory or rational phenomenon which \\r\"triggers\" the experience or act of cognition, but at the same time is informed by supra-psychological \\rattributes (Jungian archetypes and collective intellectual paradigms/themes) that reflect the society or even \\rhumanity as a whole and are not necessarily associated with the individual psyche in any sort of physical, or \\reven neurological way. At an even broader conceptual - and fundamentally (Jungian) Psychological level - Awareness represents that \\rsupra-physical and supra-psyche ground of being where the aggregate human storehouse of experience \\rresides, the defining characteristic of humanity as an organism in and of itself. As an integral part of the \\rfeedback loop for individual acts of cognition, Awareness then comes to serve not only the defining attributes \\rof the individual, but also the defining attributes of the collective, seen as an aggregate psycho-physiological \\rorganism as it were.\\n\\nHere we have these attributes of Awareness that align it quite nicely, from an \\rintellectual and metaphysical perspective, to Quantum Theory. For just as with Quantum Theory, if we \\rextrapolate its theoretical foundations to metaphysics, with Metaphysics of Awareness, knowledge is both \\rindividual state based - emerging from a specific act of cognition related to a specific event, object or thought \\r- and also at the same time is informed by both the totality of the intellectual landscape and paradigm of the \\rmind through which cognition takes place. This experience through which knowledge is created as described \\ror modelled in the Metaphysics of Awareness is akin to the way quanta, as a particle-wave, is informed, or \\rimplicitly aware, of its environment - by which for example the quanta knows about the slits in the famous \\rdouble-slit experiment and can navigate its way through them as needed, according to the stochastic models \\rthat underpin Quantum Theory. In this epistemological  framework, knowledge exists both as a discrete product as it were of the individual \\rpsyche, and at the same time exists as part of a composite whole - knowledge manifesting both as it emerges \\rwithin the individual psyche and also participating in and contributing to - again through a constant \\rinformation feedback loop of sorts - collective knowledge as it is stored and captured within Awareness which \\rfunctions across the entire human cognitive landscape.\\n\\nFurthermore, like Quantum Theory, our Metaphysics \\rof Awareness is fundamentally non-local, as understood from an epistemological perspective again, in that \\rknowledge is a function of not only the \"object\" of cognition - be it a rational formula or some result of \\rperception or a synthetic of the two - but also a function of the overarching intellectual and ontological \\rground of knowledge itself, i.e. Awareness. In this way, we can look at the Metaphysics of Awareness as a \\rquantum revolution of philosophy in much the same way as Kant\\'s philosophy reflected a so-called \\rCopernican revolution of philosophy - with his inversion of the epistemological foundation effectively being \\ranalogous to our quantizing of his metaphysics. Also, as we have hinted at already, now that we have extended Kant\\'s metaphysics to include a ground of the \\rcognitive, knowledge acquisition, process, and established Awareness as a metaphysical and ontological \\rprinciple, we have the opportunity to fully integrate Psychology into the cognitive process, taking advantage \\rof the advancements in this field since Kant established his Metaphysics of Morals at the end of the \\rEnlightenment.\\n\\nGiven the quantized nature of the Metaphysics of Awareness though, we lean less on \\rFreudian psychology and its behavioristic, really mechanistic, conception of mind, but more Jungian \\rpsychology given its more holistic approach to the understanding of human, individual behavior as (at least \\rpartially) as a function of or as it relates to the vast reservoir of ideas, mythos, and archetypes, which are \\rdrawn from what he called the collective unconscious, which is in a way a close corollary of our Awareness. In this context, we shall establish what we will call the interconnectedness principle which is derived from the \\rfact that Awareness provides the metaphysical connection for not just individual consciousness or cognition, \\rbut for all beings, all existence (all beings that are capable of cognition essentially), effectively linking all of \\rthese sentient beings that leverage and utilize this collective, aggregate, metaphysical, and psychological \\rprinciple of Awareness for cognition - a rational deduction as it were from our Metaphysics of Awareness as \\rwe have described it thus far. In this context, this interconnectedness principle can also be seen as the \\rdriving force behind Jung\\'s concept of individuation, the process by which the psyche merges with and \\rassimilates archetypes from the collective unconscious and thereby psychologically becomes fully formed or \\rcomplete, i.e. individualized.\\n\\nWith respect to Freudian psychology, we can understand his notion of desire as the driving force of behavior, \\ra construct which underpins his psychological theoretical framework more or less, as a mechanical and \\rbehavioristic reflection of a more fundamental human desire to be unified with Awareness, the very ground \\rof experience itself. It can be understood in this context as reflective of the very fundamental desire to be \\r\"whole\" again, i.e. to be integrated with Awareness itself. This is the very same principle, the same \\rmotivating force - i.e. desire - that we find in Hellenic mythos as Eros, one of the primordial deities which not \\ronly brings the kosmos into existence, but also - according to both Plato and Aristotle in fact - is responsible \\rat some level for keeping it together, as the motivating principle behind order and reason, i.e. the Judeo-\\rChristian Logos again. Furthermore, with this principle of Awareness that sits at the very heart of our new metaphysics, we now \\rhave established an intellectual bridge not only for Eastern philosophy and Western philosophy, but also a \\rmetaphysical ground for mysticism as a Psychological experience - as Awareness represents, is the \\rmetaphysical and ontological equivalent of, the penultimate ontological principle of Eastern philosophy, i.e. what is variously referred to as samādhi in Yoga, nirvana in the Buddhist tradition, and Satcitānanda in the \\rUpanishads.\\n\\nSatcitānanda is probably the most fitting term as these Eastern philosophical constructs relate \\rto the Metaphysics of Awareness given that the word is a composite in the Sanskrit of almost all of the \\runderlying philosophical, and really intellectual, paradigms that come together with and under Awareness as \\ran ontological first principle - sat, \"being\" or \"existing\", cit, \"to perceive\", \"understand\" or \"know\", and \\rananda, \"happiness\", \"pleasure\", or \"bliss\". The most common translation of this esoteric, and \\rfundamentally mystical, concept is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss-Absolute, vocabulary which has clear \\ralignment with the Western philosophical, epistemological, ontological, psychological and of course \\rtheological theoretical frameworks (bliss, ananda, having clear Freudian connotations, and then sat with \\ralmost a direct line of site into the Greek óntōs from which the discipline of ontology gets its name) that we \\rare effectively able to integrate with our Metaphysics of Awareness. In Upanishadic philosophy, \\rSatcitānanda is equated with the source of knowledge, the very ground of being itself as a theological and \\rmetaphysical principle. In this sense, Satcitānanda is Awareness - simply resting in a different metaphysical, \\rcultural, and linguistic framework (albeit still Indo-European).\\n\\nIn the words of Max Planck, one of the greatest Physicists of the 20th century by any measure (words which \\ryou won\\'t find in any Physics textbook mind you):\\r\\rAll matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and \\rholds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a \\rconscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter. Once it has been established that the penultimate ontological first principle of Eastern philosophy (primarily \\rIndian philosophy but also in the Chinese philosophical tradition as well with the Dao perhaps representing \\rthe best example) is in fact Awareness, we not only have established a metaphysical bridge between Eastern \\rand Western philosophy, but also by combining the discipline of Psychology directly into the intellectual \\rarchitecture as it were, we establish Awareness as not just an epistemological and ontological entity, a \\rrequisite metaphysical truth, but as an experiential reality. In other words, in the Metaphysics of Awareness, \\rAwareness is not only the necessary precondition for all knowledge as it is conceived in Kant\\'s cognitive \\rframework, it can also be leveraged to establish, and explain, the fundamental truths of the longstanding \\rmystical practices and disciplines that are a hallmark of the Eastern philosophical traditions, as a \\rPsychological phenomenon in and of itself.\\n\\nAwareness in this capacity, from a Psychological perspective, can be viewed as the fulfillment of the ultimate \\rdesire, that which forms the basis of humanity in a way, i.e. the direct and complete integration of the psyche \\rwith Awareness - or perhaps better put as the dissolution of the psyche, the mind, into the state of pure, \\runadulterated Awareness, which is what we have called throughout supraconsciousness. Desire fulfillment \\rthen, in this mystical context which is so fundamental to Eastern philosophy, is preserved but desire is \\runderstood as a theological imperative, one that has been expressed for millennia as reflected by the \\rcosmogonic mythos of ancient man, with universal creation being conceived as, from a mystical standpoint at \\rleast, the journey back up the metaphysical paradigm as it were straight through to Awareness itself where \\rindividuation, in its absolution, is fully realized. This Psychological interpretation of experience, which in turn \\rprovides the basis for knowledge and truth, is an integral aspect of the Metaphysics of Awareness, one of its \\rdefining features in fact.\\n\\nThis Psychological bent if we may call it that, allows for (and in a way is being \\rpursued within the more modern discipline of Cognitive Science which is very much influenced by Philosophy, \\rand in particular Kantian philosophy) what we might call the Science of the mind to be established as an \\rinterdisciplinary practice as it were - where Psychology, Philosophy, theology and mysticism can at the very \\rleast be looked upon as somewhat inter-related disciplines. To say this in a different way, in the Quantum \\rEra any complete map of reality, a description of the totality of being in all its forms, should be required to \\rincorporate the full depiction of the nature of mind as it is understood not just in the (Western) Psychological \\rsense, but also in the sense of the Eastern theo-philosophical traditions as well - a longstanding tradition \\rwhich reaches back into the very depths of antiquity which posit mind not just as a mechanistic and \\rbiochemical and neurological \"system\", but as a reflection of the eternal and ever present substratum of \\rexistence itself.\\n\\nThis Psychological reality, this metaphysics of mind, forces us to recast our epistemological position, as this \\rground of being - Awareness - is not only conceived of as a \"real\" thing in and of itself, from an \\repistemological and in turn ontological perspective, and as such reflects a certain kind of higher order \\rknowledge, but also represents the very foundations of knowledge itself from which all forms of knowledge, \\rall reality even, is based. This principle, i.e. Awareness then, in a way reflects the fundamental divide \\rbetween Eastern and Western philosophy, and arguably represents the very heart of the divide between \\rReligion and Science - from an epistemological perspective  at least - and yet we can and do effectively close \\rthis gap if we adopt the Metaphysics of Awareness as our ontological and epistemological framework. In \\rother words, in order to establish a full and complete intellectual system which covers all aspects of reality, \\restablishing the grounds for a more comprehensive and complete ontology, the prototypical reductionist \\rWestern worldview and the holistic worldview that is characteristic of the East should be looked at as \\rcomplementary and orthogonal domains of knowledge, different perspectives on the same reality, not as \\ralternative mutually exclusive domains of truth which unfortunately they are typically conceived as.\\n\\nThis integrated framework then opens all sorts of doors to understanding - and incorporating and \\rsynthesizing - all sorts and kinds of theological and metaphysical conceptions of reality that have been put \\rforth through the ages since the dawn of civilization. From a Western metaphysics perspective for example, \\rwe can see Bohm\\'s conception of the implicate order and explicate order as an analogy here, where the \\rrealm of God, i.e. theology, is reflective of the implicate order that underlies the physical universe and the \\runderlying explicate order realities that are described in Physics - one for Classical Mechanics and another for \\rQuantum Mechanics - and even another explicate, albeit higher order, of Reason itself which is the domain of \\rPhilosophy, and in turn the sub-discipline of metaphysics. Metaphysics of Awareness can also be used to contemplate and understand various forms of ancient \\rtheology and metaphysics in fact. For example, the Stoic notion of corporealism, the notion that everything \\ris \"alive\" and \"animated\" and is permeated with divine consciousness, from which the Christian concept of \\rthe Holy Spirit is derived, through the Stoic pneuma, can now be seen as a theological and philosophical (and \\rclassically Hellenic) description of Awareness as it is viewed in the Metaphysics of Awareness.\\n\\nFurthermore, \\rwe can come to a better understanding of the Indian philosophical conception of knowledge, which holds \\rthat there exists a \"higher\" form of knowledge, the direct experience of Satcitānanda or Brahman, from \\rwhich lower forms of knowledge - like for example objective realism or even Quantum Mechanics - become \\rintellectually tenable. The Metaphysics of Awareness is in a sense a mystic metaphysics that provides a \\rcognitive and rational intellectual paradigm through which we can come to a greater understanding of the \\rNeo-Platonic One for example, as well as its close corollaries the Divine Intellect and the Soul, which - like \\rthe Christian Trinity - can be viewed as a triad of theological principles through which Awareness, at both the \\rindividual and collective level, is explained. Perhaps most importantly however, we now have a framework within which theology and metaphysics - \\rReligion and Science - are established on common intellectual ground as it were, bound together with this \\rnotion of Awareness which is both local and specific to the individual psyche or mind (as is presumed and \\rreflected in the domain of Science) and at the same time non-local and reflective of Jung\\'s collective \\runconscious, the repository of human archetypes and mythos (which is reflected in Religion more or less). Once this connection is established, this further abstraction of metaphysics which provides a grounding for \\rcognition, i.e.\\n\\nAwareness, we now have the metaphysical and ontological basis for both Western philosophy, \\rwhich now includes Psychology, and Eastern philosophy, which includes mysticism. Furthermore, morality \\rnow is not just a rational deduction, a characteristic of man as a rational being as Kant establishes in his \\rphilosophy as a metaphysical deduction as it were, but now is even further reinforced as a logical conclusion \\rbased upon the metaphysical and ontological interconnectedness of all beings whose existence both depends \\rand relies on Awareness, which provides the ground of both individual existence and collective existence \\rmore broadly. To further illustrate and elucidate upon the implications of establishing Awareness as an ontological first \\rprinciple as it were, the archetype of archetypes, we can look at the classic philosophical ontological \\rargument through the lens of the Metaphysics of Awareness, where the existence of God is (attempted to be) \\restablished based upon pure Reason as it were - a topic that is front and center in Descartes\\'s Meditations on \\rFirst Philosophy for example - we have something like the following:\\ri.\\texistence is a real thing, i.e. an epistemological reality,\\rii. if anything exists, it is \"I\", from which the notion of existence in and of itself is defined,\\riii. I am a thinking, cognitive being,\\riv. thought is a characteristic of existence, i.e. being itself (ontology),\\rv.\\tideas exist (Plato, Aristotle)\\rvi.\\n\\nthe universe is inherently rational (Physics, cosmogony, Logos, Nous, etc.) vii. The rational ground of the universe is what we call metaphysics, i.e. Philosophy,\\rviii. there must exist a metaphysical ground of thought, i.e. Awareness,\\rix. Awareness is the primordial ontological first principle, i.e. arche,\\rx. The primordial first principle, again arche, equates to the Abrahamic conception of God, \\restablishing the grounds for theology\\r\\rWhile Kant is certainly correct, from a rational perspective, in pointing out that the existence of God as the \\rpenultimate intellectual idealistic abstraction, the unmoved mover as it were, is predicated upon the \\rassertion that I, and its corollary thought, exist, it nonetheless can also be held to be true that if anything at \\rall exists, it would be I as a contemplative, reflective being - a further abstraction of Descartes\\'s cogito ergo \\rsum in a sense.\\n\\nYes, the argument is circular, and Kant is surely right from an epistemological and ontological \\rstandpoint that all existence, all knowledge, must be viewed within the context of this \"thinking thing\" - as \\rreflected in Kant\\'s cognitive epistemology - but nonetheless, and as Kant himself argues, once this is \\restablished, then God - or more broadly theology - becomes a necessary condition of existence, an \\repistemological truth, even if only as a rational byproduct of existence itself, which as we point out also in \\rand of itself must exist if we take the existence of I as a fundamental postulate. Another way of saying this would be that if Physics true, if metaphysics is true, if mathematics is true, if logic \\ris true, then we must yield that truth does in fact exist - be it a subjective, cognitive property of mind \\r(according to Kant) or an empirical or rational truth that exists independently of any act of cognition or \\rhuman agency as the Enlightenment Era rationalists posited. And therefore, there must be an ideological \\rbasis for its existence which ultimately, no matter what we decide or want to call it, effectively equates with \\rTHE penultimate principle, or first principle, upon which truth itself in all its forms rests. This is God \\rmetaphysically speaking.\\n\\nIn summary then, what we end up with as a result of establishing our Metaphysics of Awareness is the \\rfollowing set of principles, or tenets: \\r\\uf0fc\\tthere must exist a ground of cognitive experience which we call Awareness, a psycho-physiological \\rconstruct that provides the metaphysical basis of cognition, of knowledge, \\r\\uf0fc\\tthis Awareness is equivalent to Jung\\'s collective unconscious, the storehouse of archetypes and \\rmythos not just for the individual, but for the \"collective\" - i.e. society, culture, humanity - as a \\rwhole\\r\\uf0fc\\tthrough Awareness we can deduce the existence of an interconnectedness principle upon which the \\rground of all existence, all being (ontology) is based,\\r\\uf0fc\\tmorality now is further reinforced by this interconnectedness principle, \"others\" - beings that exist \\routside of yourself, no longer have any metaphysical or philosophical significance. Everything is \\rconnected in a ground of Awareness. \\uf0fc\\tmorality is expanded upon to include all forms of life, as well as the planet which is effectively a \\rbiological organism that is grounded in the same Awareness upon which our consciousness rests.\\n\\nThis interconnectedness principle then allows for an expansion of morality into areas beyond human \\raffairs- given their mutual interdependency and connectedness in this ground of Awareness,\\r\\uf0fc\\tPhilosophy and Psychology are integrated within Metaphysics of Awareness as complimentary \\rdisciplines resting upon the concept of Awareness, a reflection of Jung\\'s collective unconscious - \\rstorehouse for archetypes and mythos\\r\\uf0fc\\tEastern and Western philosophy, as well as the more modern discipline of mysticism, are also \\rintegrated with Metaphysics of Awareness, again all connected via the principle of Awareness that \\rrests not only as the ground of the cognition by the human mind, but as an ontological first principle \\rupon which Metaphysics of Awareness fundamentally rests. Supraconsciousness is Awareness. Awareness then is an ontological first principle that is required for being and cognition in and of themselves \\ras intellectual and metaphysical constructs, effectively connecting the two not just from a metaphysical \\rperspective but also ontologically as well. And, with respect to the distinctively Eastern philosophical and \\rmystical implications of Metaphysics of Awareness, Awareness itself is not just an ontological construct, \\rexisting as an entity - a being - in and of itself, but also can be experienced directly, undiluted by cognition so \\rto speak.\\n\\nOn this basis, with this extension to Kant\\'s philosophy, we are able to integrate not just Eastern \\rphilosophy and Western philosophy, arguably a monumental philosophical feat in and of itself, but also \\rmysticism as well in the broadest sense as the direct experience of the ground of existence, the ground of \\rbeing, i.e. Awareness, which viewed through the intellectual lens of theology is again equivalent to God. The paradigm shift that we make here with the Metaphysics of Awareness, is that reality, being in its most \\ressential form, is not reductionist, even though this type of thinking may be extraordinarily powerful as it \\rrelates to Science. Or to say it differently, the reductionist worldview that is such a fundamental \\rcharacteristic of Science and Western philosophy in general represents truth at a lower order level of \\rexistence or reality (using Bohm\\'s conceptual framework of implicate and explicate order from an \\repistemological perspective as an analogy again), and at the same time there exists a higher order level or \\rdimension or reality or existence, ontologically prior as it were, from which lower forms of knowledge and \\rexistence depend or are predicated upon. In the holistic perspective of the world, this more fundamental perspective of Being in a Platonic sense, it is \\rchange or process that is primary - at least from a physical standpoint.\\n\\nAnd the physical reality that we can \\rsee and touch, the foundation of empirical reality as defined by the empiricists can be understood as the \\rholomovement of Bohm or the yi of the ancient Chinese which underpins the Yìjīng and in turn forms the \\rbasis of Chinese philosophy. Awareness is not a thing outside of the universal order and nature - outside of \\rus, outside the world - it permeates all of creation, a truth that was self-evident to the first philosophers in \\rantiquity as it is reflected in virtually all of the major the-philosophical traditions that we have covered in this \\rwork - Hellenic, Chinese and Indian primarily. This is in fact how these typically reductionist versus holistic worldviews were once conceived at the very \\rbeginning of the philosophical journey as it were - by the likes of Plato and Aristotle for example, or on the \\rEastern front by Lǎozǐ or Śaṅkara, or even earlier as conceived by the authors of the Upanishads, the so-\\rcalled rishis, or in the Far East as reflected again in the Yìjīng - all being representative from a philosophical \\rstandpoint of both reductionist and holistic ontological paradigms simultaneously.\\n\\nBut this was back when \\rmankind\\'s relationship with truth and knowledge was symbolic, reflected in the belief of the underlying truth \\rof mythos in antiquity, despite its allegorical approach to conveying said truth (allegoresis) which was the \\rprevalent mode of thought, belief system, in the days before philosophy, philosophia or Reason, as the \\rdominant intellectual lens through which truth, or reality, were construed. Implicit in mankind\\'s intellectual journey from symbolism, metaphor, and myth to linguistic specificity of the \\rwritten word where again Reason was looked upon as the benchmark of knowledge and truth, was the loss of \\rthe mystery of creation, which by its very nature does not lend itself to a reductionist, objective realist, \\rframework of understanding - an unintended consequence of (rational) progress as it were. This mystical \\rprogression of words to thoughts to ideas to what Pirsig and so many other sages and prophets in the history \\rof mankind, be they considered to be true mystics or not, have experienced which provide us not only with \\rthe grounds for Religion, as a prophetic revelation, but also (and this is oft overlooked) but also the grounds \\rfor the very height of philosophia. At least this is how this progression was conceived in Hellenic antiquity, an \\rexercise which was considered to be not just rational, but a reflection of (cosmic) wisdom, i.e. sophia, which \\rultimately at its summit merged with the source of creation itself.\\n\\nThis notion of Awareness then, which in Hellenic antiquity was referred to primarily as being in and of itself \\r(i.e. Platonic Being) was not only considered to be an experiential phenomenon, but also understood as the \\rvery ground of thought, the ground of ideas in and of themselves as abstract concepts, as well as the ground \\rof existence from an ontological perspective, at least in the Platonic tradition. From this vantage point, from \\ran epistemological perspective, ideas are understood as higher order constructs, archetypes, that reflect \\runiversal order, which in turn rest and depend upon an intellectual and metaphysical ground of Awareness. In this context, things - objects or physical reality - reflect a lower order construct, ontologically speaking, \\rthan ideas, which again rest in the ground of Awareness. In a sense then, the Metaphysics of Awareness can \\rbe seen as idealistic - again in the Platonic sense - but its inherent idealism is not as an epistemological \\rimperative, but an ontological paradigm within which both ideas and objective reality are both seen as real, \\ror true/  \\rThis is what the Neo-Platonists had right, and the Gnostics as well, from which we have the notion of Nous, \\rLogos, and the Divine Intellect - each representing that primordial ordering force which underpinned, and \\rwas the source of, universal creation, and at the same time permeates it and binds it together in a sense - at \\rleast from an metaphysical perspective.\\n\\nAlthough that which truly binds it, what the Stoics and even the \\rChristians had right in this sense, is not an intellectual construct, even though it may, and no doubt does, \\rreflect a fundamentally divine sense of order, but is \"spiritual\" in a sense, because the totality of being, the \\runiverse, is fundamentally alive, i.e. is \"aware\". This very fundamental (metaphysical, ontological and \\rtheological) idea goes back to the early Indo-Europeans, from which we have inherited the notion of divine \\rand its relationship with breath, or spirit - Holy Spirit, pneuma, prāṇa, etc.- aligning directly to Awareness as a \\rprimordial first principle in the Metaphysics of Awareness. In conclusion then, while the written word represents arguably one of the defining, and most influential, of \\rall of mankind\\'s inventions, in its Indo-European variant it nonetheless carries with it reductionist, i.e. objective realist metaphysical implications. So while the written word no doubt represents the most \\rsignificant technological innovation of ancient man that provides the intellectual architecture, the building \\rblocks really, of philosophy in antiquity which in turn forms the basis of Philosophy and Science in the post \\rEnlightenment Era, a fundamental source of much of its expressive and intellectual power as it were, it \\rnonetheless limits our understanding to a large degree of the bigger picture.\\n\\nIn this sense, if we look at \\rReligion and Science not as separate domains of knowledge (with never the two shall meet so to speak) but if \\rwe see them as different perspectives on the world order through this lens of holistic versus reductionist \\rontologies, as again is reflected and captured in the Metaphysics of Awareness, we see a much more \\rcomplete picture of the world where the Eastern and Western vantage points serve as complimentary \\rintellectual domains, two parts and perspectives on the entire domain of knowledge for the entire human \\rexperience - the Yīn-Yáng of the entire expanse of human knowledge as it were rather than mutually \\rexclusive domains of truth. The Metaphysics of Awareness then, is a sort of metaphysical synthetic that leverages some of the very \\rfundamental principles that rest at the heart of ancient philosophy, i.e. philosophia which subsumed \\rtheology, prior to the division between Eastern and Western philosophy which is so fundamental to the \\rphilosophical landscape today. The Metaphysics of Awareness reflects a more holistic conception of the \\runiversal world order, a worldview that was predominant well before ontology, epistemology, theology or \\rmetaphysics even existed as intellectual constructs much less specific domains of knowledge in and of \\rthemselves, when the now more predominant, Western, reductionist worldview - baked into the language \\ritself - had yet to take over the intellectual landscape.\\n\\nAnd as such the Metaphysics of Awareness implies a \\rreality that reflects first order principles of unity and emanation, principles that rest at the very heart of \\rancient philosophy in virtually all its forms- back to the beginning as it were. We can also quite powerfully \\rdraw a line between the Metaphysics of Awareness and Physics, with the so-called Ontological Interpretation \\rof Quantum Mechanics as established from within the Physics community itself by David Bohm with his pilot-\\rwave theory, which in its fullest and most mature form is referred to as Bohmian Mechanics, or de Broglie-\\rBohm theory - the mathematics of which was firmly established to be consistent with both Quantum \\rMechanics and Classical Mechanics decades ago. Nonetheless, given the state of affairs in the global \\rcommunity at present, it is well worth a new consideration, especially given the proliferation of Eastern \\rphilosophy and mysticism as we move well into the 21st century. While this specific interpretation, really formulation, of Quantum Mechanics, does not necessarily change its \\rfundamental characteristics and/or mathematical foundations, it nonetheless adds the notion of quantum \\rpotential to its mathematical foundations, placing it on deterministic foundations even if it relaxes the notion \\rof locality which is so fundamental to Classical Mechanics.\\n\\nOne could certainly make the argument, and \\rBohm himself does to a certain degree, that Bohmian Mechanics adds the notion of Awareness into the very \\rheart of Quantum Mechanics, as the metaphysical and ontological ground to his conception of undivided \\rwholeness. This is the Metaphysics of Awareness, a Philosophical rendition of Bohm\\'s undivided wholeness as \\rit were, a new metaphysics for the Quantum Era whereby the very height of Western philosophy is integrated \\rwith the very height of Eastern philosophy. Where the dualism of Kant and the non-dualism of Śaṅkara is \\rfully integrated within a single metaphysical and epistemological paradigm which provides the rational \\rfoundations for not only Philosophy and Psychology, but for theology and mysticism as well - establishing the \\rrational foundations for God as a necessary condition to existence and aligning Philosophy with ancient \\rmythos as it has been conceived since the very origins of civilization. With the Metaphysics of Awareness we have established Awareness as an ontological first principle, a \\rPsychological and Philosophical imperative that provides the foundation for all of existence, for all \\rknowledge. For the Age of Reason is now officially behind us, and we must, desperately, usher in a new Era - \\rthe Quantum Era. And let it be ushered in properly not by Physics, Psychology or Religion - but by \\rPhilosophy, like every Era should be.\\n\\nWhereby we may finally establish the verity of Awareness as the \\rmetaphysical ground of existence itself, a new epistemological framework that is grounded not just in \\rPhilosophy, but in Physics as well, through mathematics, the holy grail of philosophy and theology since the \\rvery dawn of civilization in the West.', metadata={'source': 'data_input/tr/tr.txt'})]"
