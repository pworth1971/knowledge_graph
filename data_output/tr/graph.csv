unified field theory|einstein|Einstein first outlined the quest for a Unified Field Theory after the advancements of Quantum Theory.|568f10f17e7b40edb122de1200e7f24e||
quantum theory|classical mechanics|From a pure intellectual perspective, from a metaphysical perspective, we see analogs for these ideological challenges in the domain of Physics, crystalizing in the search for a so-called Unified Field Theory where Classical Mechanics and Quantum Theory both coexist.|568f10f17e7b40edb122de1200e7f24e||
many worlds interpretation|bohmian mechanics|Since the introduction and acceptance of Quantum Theory, we have been exposed to a variety of intellectual paradigms intended to explain how these seemingly contradictory worlds, Classical Mechanics and Quantum Theory, can both be true at the same time - many worlds interpretation being one such example, or Bohmian Mechanics which has given us this notion of holomovement and implicate order.|568f10f17e7b40edb122de1200e7f24e||
locality|eastern philosophy|Furthermore, these developments in Physics have interestingly led to many proponents of Eastern philosophy to look at some of the underlying foundational precepts of Quantum Theory - locality being perhaps the most prominent of these - as consistent with their ontology, the world as an expression of divine consciousness where the system as a whole informs local events as it were.|568f10f17e7b40edb122de1200e7f24e||

eastern philosophical traditions|spread of eastern philosophical traditions|Since the beginning of the 20th century, due to globalization and technological advancements, Eastern philosophical traditions have spread beyond their traditional borders in the West. This diffusion has been largely driven by materialistic factors, such as an obsession with health and well-being. However, this spread also has significant philosophical and theological implications. The Eastern worldview is now familiar to many people in the West, and the concept of an underlying, active consciousness that manifests both the mind and physical world is not entirely foreign or outrageous.|b998d992c22c43d9b920a21b5424e4aa||
eastern philosophical traditions|rejection by scientific community|Despite the fact that the idea of an underlying, active consciousness from which both the mind and physical world manifest rests or depends upon for existence has been largely rejected by the Scientific community.|b998d992c22c43d9b920a21b5424e4aa||
religion|theological belief systems|The rational foundations of Religion, theology, has been under attack since the Scientific Revolution more or less. These forms of Eastern philosophy integrate theology and metaphysics, along with spiritual practices like meditation, to facilitate and demonstrate the underlying ontological truth of said theological belief systems.|6fbb710e9c8241a9b484791fdf62911b||

religion|terrorism|These trends have not only metaphysical and theological implications, but also moral and ethical ones as well. The problem effectively runs across a variety of intellectual lines but, like alcoholism or drug addiction or any problem for that matter, the first step to solving said problem is recognizing that there is in fact a problem.|6fbb710e9c8241a9b484791fdf62911b||
religion|morality and ethics|A further attack on the religious establishment while (superficially) many may not have a problem with, and many in the atheist community especially directly espouse, leads us to the very precarious position again as to the basis of, and fundamental attributes of, morality and ethics.|6fbb710e9c8241a9b484791fdf62911b||

individual problems we have laid out|level of crisis that we are at given the scope of all of the problems put together|It's not clear that we as a global community have reached that conclusion yet - not just for each of the individual problems we have laid out, but even the level of crisis that we are at given the scope of all of the problems put together.|2d37d4cc51cb402685ac2df5987b839b||
individual problems|each of them individually and then the group of them collectively|Having said that, certainly a step in the right direction is to try and establish the proper and appropriate intellectual framework out of which the solutions to these problems - each of them individually and then the group of them collectively - at least have the potential of being solved.|2d37d4cc51cb402685ac2df5987b839b||
nation-state and global level|socio-political structures|need to be established that again have the appropriate intellectual paradigm or worldview such that the problems can be attacked and addressed at the nation-state and global level - a two-pronged approach as it were.|2d37d4cc51cb402685ac2df5987b839b||
intellectual framework|proper and appropriate intellectual framework|From the author's point of view at least, in order to establish the proper and appropriate intellectual framework we must truly recognize - from an epistemological perspective - that...|db5b40459bf342e7b978a9727d1303fc||

social good|liberal or philosophical idea|God - if he does indeed exist - needs to be placed on former, more realistic, footing such that morality and the social good in and of itself is not a 'liberal' or philosophical idea,|db5b40459bf342e7b978a9727d1303fc||
interconnectedness|all living beings|...but is the most practical of rational deductions that is based upon the fundamental understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings - again not on just an intellectual or ethereal level, but on a practical and very grounded level as reflected in the 'mystical' experience as it is understood by the Eastern philosophical traditions.|db5b40459bf342e7b978a9727d1303fc||
dualistic world|objectivity|in this context, the concept of a dualistic world is related to the concept of objectivity because even the very description of the problem of determining the extent to which mystical frameworks can be laid out in a pure rational model is tainted with objectivity, as it presupposes a separation between that which is perceived and the perceiver. This separation reinforces the dualistic nature of our worldview.|b609b63826684f3c9c9a1c5f1205d61a||
divine being|god|the concept of a divine being, i.e. God, is related to the concept of God because both concepts refer to a supernatural entity that is believed to have created the universe and us.|b609b63826684f3c9c9a1c5f1205d61a||
intellectual paradigm|context of crises|the concept of an intellectual paradigm is related to the context of crises because the need for an intellectual paradigm arises in response to the challenges and threats that are confronting us during times of crisis.|b609b63826684f3c9c9a1c5f1205d61a||
necessary condition|successfully through the crisis of our time|the concept of a necessary condition is related to the concept of successfully passing through the crisis of our time because both concepts refer to conditions that must be met in order for us to overcome the challenges and threats we face during times of crisis.|b609b63826684f3c9c9a1c5f1205d61a||

indo-european linguistic construct|subject verb object|providing a tremendously powerful intellectual tool through which we can not only explore our reality, our world - describe it, articulate it, improve upon it, etc. - but also persist information and knowledge itself so that the sum total of knowledge is carried forward from one generation to the next with a high degree of specificity.|54c50bfcac78406189298b35e66a867f||
subject-object-metaphysics|linguistic framework|embedded into not just our intellectual framework, but even our linguistic framework as well, leaving us with a classical chick and egg problem as it were. Once that linguistic invention is applied, we are left with the foregone conclusion that our worldview must be reductionist - it has to be, because that is the only way we can express anything, in any Indo-European language really, the language family that that has provided the linguistic, and effectively the intellectual, foundations of the West. Every time you try and solve it you go further down the rabbit hole as it were.|54c50bfcac78406189298b35e66a867f||
god|creation|God is everything, God is in everything and as such is the ground of all experience and in turn is the (intellectual as well as physical and spiritual) ground of experience in and of itself - this is essentially what we find in Upanishadic philosophy as Satcitānanda and in the West is reflected perhaps most eloquently in the Neo-Platonic One. So linguistically then, we are almost forced to go back to the very foundations of theology, metaphysics really, in order to connect this very ancient notion of God as an integral aspect of his creation - God is everything, God is in everything and as such is the ground of all experience and in turn is the (intellectual as well as physical and spiritual) ground of experience in and of itself.|03036991c3c1430194b17a581d17aeac||

plato|theologian|Despite his rational bent, he still nonetheless captured in a way that ancient mystical quality that is characteristic of the Paleolithic religions throughout Eurasia which preceded him - what we refer to quite broadly as shamanism.|bd5d64482223406f8260808f4dcf444b||

brahman|brahmā|Brahman, a metaphysical abstraction in the extracted ontology, is related to Brahmā, the creator of the universe in the Vedic mythos. This relationship stems from Brahman being minus the numerological significance inherent to the Neo-Platonic One.|11d53ee631b148c4ba2dfe7412820c02||
nous|ṛta|The cosmic ordering principle of Ṛta, which comes to be understood as dharma in the later Indian philosophical tradition and Buddhism, corresponds quite elegantly to Nous, a sort of Divine Intellect that is rational and reflects a sense of order in Neo-Platonic philosophy.|11d53ee631b148c4ba2dfe7412820c02||
dharma|nous|In both Neo-Platonism as well as with Upanishadic philosophy, dharma, the cosmos is brought into existence through this all-pervading cosmic principle reflected in the individual Soul, which corresponds quite neatly to Nous, a sort of Divine Intellect that is rational and reflects a sense of order.|11d53ee631b148c4ba2dfe7412820c02||
soul|ātman|Furthermore, in both Neo-Platonism as well as with Upanishadic philosophy and Christianity as well, the individual manifestation of Brahman through which his creation is experienced, referred to as the Soul, corresponds again quite neatly to Ātman.|11d53ee631b148c4ba2dfe7412820c02||

ancient philosophical systems|theological aspects|Despite their power in integrating the mystical directly into the philosophical framework as if were, ancient philosophical systems are lacking in terms of integrating the last millennia or so of intellectual developments, specifically Science and philosophy advancements since Kant, who effectively integrates empiricist (materialist) and rationalist (idealists) philosophical schools.|b74d2800be8b40bcb70811733e221f0d||
kant|god|In Kant's philosophy, God is an intellectual construct, a necessary condition of his Metaphysics of Morals, but nonetheless not the ontological penultimate principle in any way.|b74d2800be8b40bcb70811733e221f0d||

kantian|metaphysics|A Kantian would argue that the question of the significance of this concept in navigating through reality is of no consequence epistemologically as all knowing, all knowledge itself, is a process of apprehension based upon sensory experience combined with perception (aesthetics) and comprehension and understanding as pure cognitive facilities (logic) - at least according to Kant.|7023fe9fbec84ed1b134c069e638b98f||
kant|empricial realist position|Kant yields to an emprirical realist position more or less, expanding the position somewhat to include a priori concepts such as time and space which allow for the inclusion of classically rationalist epistemological positions to be satisfied with his so-called transcendental idealism - but bounded the notion of knowledge itself within the confines of the mind, and cognition, effectively.|7023fe9fbec84ed1b134c069e638b98f||

In order to account for mysticism, or God really, in any sort of intellectual framework, any sort of ideological system, we must move beyond Reason given said constraints of the tool at hand. Therefore, in order to create an ontological framework which accounts for, and describes in any sort of meaningful way, ideas that are fundamentally supra-rational, i.e. God as reflected in fundamentally mystical states of consciousness or being, we must, again as a rational deduction of sorts, establish a system that subsumes Reason itself.|4edb984a9c384c04bf745f86fdc402d2||

understanding|awareness|Similar to faculties of perception and comprehension, Understanding and Awareness work together to provide the psychological grounding of the experience.|5833644e8aaa4506abe6d53df667ebbe||
awareness|ontological entity|In order for any experience or act of cognition to occur, and in turn for any form of knowledge to be acquired or gained as a result of said experience of act of cognition, there must exist an ontological entity called Awareness. This implies that without this Awareness, the cognitive process from which knowledge is derived is incomplete.|45258218035341fda8c65a376568e0e0||
awareness|epistemological entity|As a prerequisite component of the process by which knowledge is gained or arrived at, Awareness must be an ontological entity in and of itself.

kant's metaphysics|reason itself|Awareness can and should be understood as a logical extension of Kant's metaphysics which establishes mind as the ontological primordial principle within which knowledge must be defined in relation to, providing the metaphysical ground for Reason itself.|653aa51dec9448348a8c1be7104aa27d||
awareness|supra-rational|Awareness is a component of the cognitive process that operates at a higher level of abstraction and symbolic representation, providing a contextual framework for experience and knowledge absorption.|53c6f9038192467e90756650c2625407||
awareness|platonic forms|Awareness is related to Platonic forms, which are abstract concepts or idealized entities that exist independently of physical objects, as Awareness operates with symbols and levels of abstraction.|53c6f9038192467e90756650c2625407||
cognitive faculties|comprehension or understanding|Cognitive faculties, such as comprehension or understanding, are linear algorithms that apply to grouping, sorting, attribute, and quality determination, whereas Awareness provides a supra-rational ground for the cognitive process.|53c6f9038192467e90756650c2625407||
metaphysics of awareness|epistemological framework|The Metaphysics of Awareness can be considered as a metaphysical paradigm that arises from applying quantum-like principles to the prevailing epistemological framework in philosophy, which is inherently classical in nature.|3346d49ee562470c9e788acb63c5fe29||
metaphysics of awareness|social or human focused content|The Metaphysics of Awareness deals with metaphysical concepts that are not necessarily tied to any object or rational paradigm, but have social or human-focused content and shape.|3346d49ee562470c9e788acb63c5fe29||
metaphysics of awareness|jungian archetypes|The Metaphysics of Awareness encompasses Jungian archetypes, which are a priori knowledge that is not tied to any object or rational paradigm but has social or human-focused content and shape.|3346d49ee562470c9e788acb63c5fe29||
metaphysics of awareness|classical concept|In contrast to the Metaphysics of Awareness, which is a metaphysical paradigm arrived at via quantum-like principles, modern Western philosophy, as established by Kant primarily, considers knowledge to be a fundamentally classical concept.|3346d49ee562470c9e788acb63c5fe29||
metaphysics of awareness|cognitive process|What we are doing here to Kant's cognitive process, his epistemological framework, is effectively quantizing it.|3346d49ee562470c9e788acb63c5fe29||
awareness|cognitive framework|In the context provided, Awareness is introduced as a metaphysical construct that brings fundamentally quantum like features to Kant's epistemological framework. This suggests that Awareness has an impact on the cognitive framework, which can be understood as a result of the (mental) processes of perception, comprehension and understanding complemented or augmented by Awareness that bring 'non-local' attributes and qualities to the experience via its grounding, and meta-defining function in the cognitive framework itself.|b43924f603d64776bdd16c321c55d996||
awareness|individualized and discrete 'thing'|The context provided also suggests that with the introduction of Awareness, knowledge can be conceived of both as an individualized and discrete 'thing' in and of itself.|b43924f603d64776bdd16c321c55d996||
knowledge|perception, comprehension and understanding|The context provided also implies that knowledge can be defined more holistically as a result of the (mental) processes of perception, comprehension and understanding complemented or augmented by Awareness.|b43924f603d64776bdd16c321c55d996||
awareness|quantum theory|Theoretical foundations of Quantum Theory align nicely with the intellectual and metaphysical perspective of Awareness, as knowledge in both is individual state based but also informed by the totality of the intellectual landscape and paradigm of the mind.|d92341df77dc4638b9198610e671f374||
knowledge|individual psyche|In this epistemological framework, knowledge exists both as a discrete product within the individual psyche and also participates in and contributes to collective knowledge as it is stored and captured within Awareness.|d92341df77dc4638b9198610e671f374||
quantum|slits|Just as with Quantum Theory, if we extrapolate its theoretical foundations to metaphysics, knowledge is both individual state based and informed by its environment, like how quanta navigates through the slits in the famous double-slit experiment.|d92341df77dc4638b9198610e671f374||
cognition|specific event, object or thought|Knowledge is both individual state based - emerging from a specific act of cognition related to a specific event, object or thought.|d92341df77dc4638b9198610e671f374||
collective knowledge|human cognitive landscape|Knowledge manifests both as it emerges within the individual psyche and also participates in and contributes to collective knowledge, according to a constant information feedback loop across the entire human cognitive landscape.|d92341df77dc4638b9198610e671f374||
metaphysics of awareness|quantum revolution|Furthermore, like Quantum Theory, our Metaphysics of Awareness is fundamentally non-local, as understood from an epistemological perspective again, in that knowledge is a function of not only the 'object' of cognition - be it a rational formula or some result of perception or a synthetic of the two - but also a function of the overarching intellectual and ontological ground of knowledge itself, i.e. Awareness.|e30fafc83c834421a2e4323c0a557bfd||

desire|awareness|In Freudian psychology, desire is understood as the driving force of behavior and can be interpreted as a reflection of the more fundamental human desire to be united with Awareness, the very ground of experience itself. This principle of Awareness represents the metaphysical and ontological equivalent of samādhi in Yoga, nirvana in the Buddhist tradition, and Satcitānanda in the Upanishads.|d2ba514cb22640779bcb8a12f9a1520c||
eros|kosmos|In Hellenic mythos, Eros is responsible at some level for keeping the kosmos together as the motivating principle behind order and reason, which not only brings the cosmos into existence but also maintains its unity.|d2ba514cb22640779bcb8a12f9a1520c||
logos|kosmos|In Judeo-Christian tradition, Logos is responsible for keeping the kosmos together as the motivating principle behind order and reason, which not only brings the cosmos into existence but also maintains its unity.|d2ba514cb22640779bcb8a12f9a1520c||

satcitānanda|awareness|In Upanishadic philosophy, Satcitānanda is equated with the source of knowledge and the very ground of being itself as a theological and metaphysical principle. This aligns with the Western philosophical concept of ontology which gets its name from the Greek óntōs. Therefore, Satcitānanda can be seen as Awareness, resting in a different metaphysical, cultural, and linguistic framework.|7420afc0d4c447b98b3886f056e77f39||
existence-knowledge-bliss-absolute|satcitānanda|The most common translation of Satcitānanda is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss-Absolute, vocabulary which has clear alignment with Western philosophical theoretical frameworks such as ontology, psychology, and theology.|7420afc0d4c447b98b3886f056e77f39||
being|satcitānanda|The word Satcitānanda is a composite in the Sanskrit of almost all of the underlying philosophical, intellectual, and ontological paradigms that come together with and under Awareness as an ontological first principle. This includes sat, 'being' or 'existing', which has a direct line of site into the Greek óntōs from which the discipline of ontology gets its name.|7420afc0d4c447b98b3886f056e77f39||
perception|satcitānanda|Cit, 'to perceive', 'understand', or 'know', is also a part of the composite term Satcitānanda.|7420afc0d4c447b98b3886f056e77f39||
happiness|satcitānanda|Another component of the term Satcitānanda is ananda, 'happiness', 'pleasure', or 'bliss'. This has clear Freudian connotations.|7420afc0d4c447b98b3886f056e77f39||
